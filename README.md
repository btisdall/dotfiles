# Dotfiles

If you're looking for the ultimate dotfile starter pack you've probably come to the wrong place. This stuff is here because occasionally people express interest in some aspect of my setup and I wanted to have any easy way to share it with them. I hope some of what's here proves useful to you.

## Installation

__The install script is provided as-is, please back up your dotfiles before using it.__

By default the script will ask before overwriting a target, you can set `FORCE_OVERWRITE` to a non-empty value to turn this behaviour off.
